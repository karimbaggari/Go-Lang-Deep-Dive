# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 10 - Generics**

Generics in Go allow you to write flexible and reusable code. With generics, functions and data structures can operate on different types without needing to rewrite the code for each type. This leads to cleaner, more efficient code.

## **1. Introduction to Generics**
- **File:** [intro_to_generics.go](generics/intro_to_generics.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the concept of generics in Go, showing how you can write flexible and reusable code by allowing functions and data structures to work with different types.

---

## **2. Type Constraints**
- **File:** [02_type_constraints.go](generics/02_type_constraints.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to define **type constraints** in Go. It allows functions to only accept types that satisfy specific conditions, ensuring type safety and preventing errors.

## **3. Type Aliases**
- **File:** [03_type_alias.go](generics/03_type_alias.go)  
- **Description:** In Go, **type aliases** allow you to create more readable and reusable types. This file shows how to define type aliases and how they simplify your code, especially when working with complex types or generic functions. Instead of repeating type definitions, type aliases allow you to create shorter, more meaningful names for complex types.

## **4. Type Constraints & Types**
- **File:** [04_generics_examples.go](generics/04_generics_examples.go)  
- **Description:** This file explores how type constraints and types work together. It shows how to create generic functions that are flexible, but still enforce certain rules to ensure that only valid types are used.

## **Conclusion**
Generics in Go provide a powerful way to write flexible and reusable code. This section covers the fundamentals of generics, including:
- **Type Constraints**: Restrict which types can be used with your functions.
- **Type Aliases**: Creating more readable and reusable types.
- **Concrete vs. Interface Types**: Understanding the difference when working with generics.

Generics allow you to write more abstract and adaptable code, improving your code's maintainability and reducing duplication.
