# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 12 - Concurrency**

Concurrency is a powerful feature in Go that allows developers to perform multiple tasks at the same time. In this section, we'll cover key concurrency concepts such as **Goroutines**, **Wait Groups**, and **Race Conditions**.

## **1. Goroutines**
- **File:** [01_goroutines.go](concurrency/01_goroutines.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to create and manage **goroutines**. Goroutines enable concurrent execution of functions, allowing your program to handle multiple tasks at once without waiting for one to finish before starting the next.

## **2. Wait Groups**
- **File:** [02_wait_group.go](concurrency/02_wait_group.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to use **wait groups** in Go. A wait group helps synchronize goroutines, ensuring that all goroutines have finished executing before the program proceeds.

## **3. Race Conditions**
- **File:** [03_race_conditions.go](concurrency/03_race_conditions.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates what **race conditions** are in concurrent programming and how they can cause unpredictable behavior. It also covers how to detect and prevent race conditions using synchronization tools in Go.

## **Conclusion**
Concurrency is a key strength of Go, allowing developers to write more efficient and responsive applications. This section covers the essentials of concurrency, including:
- **Goroutines** for concurrent tasks,
- **Wait Groups** for synchronization, and
- **Race Conditions** and how to avoid them.

These concepts form the foundation of writing robust and scalable concurrent programs in Go.
