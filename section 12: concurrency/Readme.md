# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 12 - Concurrency**


## **1. Goroutines**
- **File:** [01_goroutines.go](concurrency/01_goroutines.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to create and manage goroutines for concurrent execution in Go.

## **2. Wait Groups**
- **File:** [02_wait_group.go](concurrency/02_wait_group.go)  
- **Description:** This file illustrates how to use wait groups to synchronize goroutines, ensuring that all goroutines complete before proceeding.

## **3. Race Conditions**
- **File:** [03_race_conditions.go](concurrency/03_race_conditions.go)  
- **Description:** This example explains race conditions in concurrent programming and how to detect and avoid them in Go.

## **Conclusion**
Concurrency is a powerful feature in Go that allows developers to write efficient and responsive applications. This section covers various aspects of concurrency, including goroutines, wait groups, and race conditions, providing a solid foundation for building concurrent programs in Go.
