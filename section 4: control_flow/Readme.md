# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 4 - Control Flow**

## **1. If Statements and Comparisons**
- **File:** [01_if_statements.go](control_flow/01_if_statements.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates the use of `if` statements for making decisions based on conditions. It includes examples of using an initializer within an `if` statement to evaluate conditions.

## **2. Logical Operators**
- **File:** [02_logical_operators.go](control_flow/02_logical_operators.go)  
- **Description:** This program illustrates the use of logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in conditional statements to evaluate multiple conditions.

## **3. Switch Statements**
- **File:** [03_switch_statements.go](control_flow/03_switch_statements.go)  
- **Description:** This file provides examples of using `switch` statements for multi-way branching. It includes a switch without a condition to demonstrate how to evaluate multiple expressions.

## **4. Select Statements**
- **File:** [04_select_statements.go](control_flow/04_select_statements.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to use `select` statements for handling multiple channel operations in Go, allowing for concurrent communication between goroutines.

## **5. For Loops**
- **File:** [05_for_loops.go](control_flow/05_for_loops.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates the classic `for` loop, a while-like loop, and an infinite loop, showcasing different ways to iterate in Go.

## **6. Nested Loops**
- **File:** [06_nested_loops.go](control_flow/06_nested_loops.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates how to use nested loops to perform multiple iterations inside loops, providing a clear understanding of how to manage complex iterations.

## **7. For Range Loops**
- **File:** [07_for_range_loops.go](control_flow/07_for_range_loops.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates the `for range` loop for iterating over slices, maps, and strings, providing a concise way to access elements and their indices.

## **Conclusion**
Control flow is essential for directing the execution of code based on conditions and iterations. This section covers various control flow constructs in Go, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to manage program logic effectively.
