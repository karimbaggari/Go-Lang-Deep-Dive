# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 8 - Error Handling**

## **1. Introduction to Error Handling**
- **File:** [01_error_handling_intro.go](error_handling/01_error_handling_intro.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains what error handling is and why it’s important. You’ll learn how Go helps you catch and manage errors, so your programs can handle problems without crashing.

## **2. Custom Error Types**
- **File:** [02_custom_error_types.go](error_handling/02_custom_error_types.go)  
- **Description:** This file shows how to create your own error types in Go. Custom errors make it easier to describe what went wrong and give more information about the issue.

## **3. Wrapping Errors**
- **File:** [03_wrapping_errors.go](error_handling/03_wrapping_errors.go)  
- **Description:** This file teaches how to wrap errors using `fmt.Errorf`. Wrapping errors adds extra context, so it’s clear where and why something went wrong. This makes debugging much simpler.

## **4. Panic and Recover**
- **File:** [04_panic_and_recover.go](error_handling/04_panic_and_recover.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains `panic` and `recover`, two tools in Go for handling serious problems. `panic` stops the program when something really bad happens, and `recover` helps you take control and fix things before the program crashes.

## **5. Error Handling Best Practices**
- **File:** [05_error_handling_best_practices.go](error_handling/05_error_handling_best_practices.go)  
- **Description:** This file shares tips on how to handle errors the right way. You’ll learn when to log errors, when to return them, and how to make your programs handle errors gracefully.

## **6. Using the `errors` Package**
- **File:** [06_using_errors_package.go](error_handling/06_using_errors_package.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces Go’s built-in `errors` package. It explains how to create simple errors with `errors.New` and how to check if two errors are the same using `errors.Is`.

## **Conclusion**
Errors are a natural part of coding, and handling them well makes your programs more reliable. In this section, you’ll learn everything from creating simple error messages to using advanced tools like custom error types and `recover`. By the end, you’ll know how to write programs that can handle problems smoothly and keep running.
