# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 10 - Pointers**

## **1. Introduction to Pointers**
- **File:** [01_pointers_intro.go](pointers/01_pointers_intro.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces pointers, which are variables that store memory addresses instead of actual data. Pointers allow you to directly access and modify the memory of other variables, making them a powerful tool in Go programming.

## **2. Seeing Types & Values for Pointers**
- **File:** [02_types_and_values.go](pointers/02_types_and_values.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to declare pointers and examine their types and the values they point to. You’ll learn how pointers work behind the scenes and how to recognize what they are pointing to in memory.

## **3. Dereferencing Pointers**
- **File:** [03_dereferencing_pointers.go](pointers/03_dereferencing_pointers.go)  
- **Description:** Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value stored at the memory address the pointer is referencing. This file shows you how to dereference pointers in Go using the `*` operator.

## **4. Pass by Value, Pointers, Reference Types, and Mutability**
- **File:** [04_pass_by_value_and_reference.go](pointers/04_pass_by_value_and_reference.go)  
- **Description:** Go normally passes data to functions by copying it (pass by value). This file explains how pointers can be used to pass references to the original data, allowing functions to modify the data directly.

## **5. Pointer and Value Semantics Defined**
- **File:** [05_pointer_value_semantics.go](pointers/05_pointer_value_semantics.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains the difference between pointer semantics (working with references) and value semantics (working with copies). Understanding these concepts helps you decide when to use pointers for better memory management.

## **6. Pointer & Value Semantics Heuristic**
- **File:** [06_pointer_value_semantics_heuristic.go](pointers/06_pointer_value_semantics_heuristic.go)  
- **Description:** This file provides simple guidelines to help you decide when to use pointers or values. You’ll learn when pointers are more efficient and when values are sufficient for your needs.

## **7. Pointers and Values: The Stack and the Heap**
- **File:** [07_stack_and_heap.go](pointers/07_stack_and_heap.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces stack and heap memory in Go. It explains how data is stored in these two areas and how pointers allow you to control where and how memory is allocated.

## **Conclusion**
Pointers are a key concept in Go that let you directly interact with memory. By learning about pointers, you’ll be able to write more efficient and flexible code. This section covers everything from basic pointer usage to advanced topics like memory areas (stack and heap) and when to use pointers versus values. After completing this section, you’ll have a strong foundation in Go’s memory management.
