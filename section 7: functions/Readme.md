# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 7 - Functions**

## **1. Introduction to Functions**
- **File:** [01_function_basics.go](functions/01_function_basics.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the basics of functions in Go, including function definition, calling functions, and using named return values.

## **2. Variadic Functions**
- **File:** [02_variadic_functions.go](functions/02_variadic_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to create functions that accept a variable number of arguments, showcasing the use of variadic parameters.

## **3. Anonymous Functions**
- **File:** [03_anonymous_functions.go](functions/03_anonymous_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file illustrates the concept of anonymous functions, including how to define and invoke them inline.

## **4. Higher-Order Functions**
- **File:** [04_higher_order_functions.go](functions/04_higher_order_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to create higher-order functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.

## **5. Methods with Structs**
- **File:** [05_methods_with_structs.go](functions/05_methods_with_structs.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to define methods on structs, demonstrating how to associate behavior with data types.

## **6. Recursion**
- **File:** [06_recursion_example.go](functions/06_recursion_example.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates the concept of recursion in Go, showing how a function can call itself to solve problems.

## **7. Closures**
- **File:** [07_closures.go](functions/07_closures.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains closures in Go, demonstrating how functions can capture and remember the environment in which they were created.

## **8. Function Expressions**
- **File:** [08_function_expressions.go](functions/08_function_expressions.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to use function expressions to create functions dynamically and assign them to variables.

## **Conclusion**
Functions are a fundamental building block in Go, allowing for code reuse, modularity, and abstraction. This section covers various aspects of functions, including their definitions, types, and advanced concepts like closures and recursion.
