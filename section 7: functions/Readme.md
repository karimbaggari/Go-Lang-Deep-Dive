# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 7 - Functions**

## **1. Introduction to Functions**
- **File:** [01_function_basics.go](functions/01_function_basics.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains what functions are and why they are useful. You’ll learn how to create a function, call it, and use named return values, which make your code easier to understand.

## **2. Variadic Functions**
- **File:** [02_variadic_functions.go](functions/02_variadic_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file shows how to create functions that can accept any number of arguments. For example, you could create a function to add numbers and use it with 2, 3, or even 10 numbers.

## **3. defer**
- **File:** [03_defer_example.go](functions/03_defer_example.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the `defer` keyword, which is like saying, "Do this later, just before leaving the function." It’s often used for cleaning up, like closing files after you're done with them.

## **4. Methods with Structs**
- **File:** [04_methods_with_structs.go](functions/04_methods_with_structs.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to create methods, which are functions that belong to a specific type, like a struct. Methods let you add behaviors to your data, like calculating something based on the values in the struct.

## **5. Interfaces and Polymorphism**
- **File:** [05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go](functions/05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces interfaces, which are like a set of rules. Any type that follows those rules can use the interface. This makes your code more flexible and allows different types to work together.

## **6. Anonymous Functions**
- **File:** [06_anonymous_functions.go](functions/06_anonymous_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to create a function without giving it a name. Anonymous functions are useful when you need a quick, short function to do something right away.

## **7. Recursion**
- **File:** [07_recursion_example.go](functions/07_recursion_example.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains recursion, which happens when a function calls itself to solve smaller pieces of a big problem. For example, you can use recursion to calculate a factorial or process nested data.

## **8. Wrapper Functions**
- **File:** [08_wrapper_functions.go](functions/08_wrapper_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file shows how to create wrapper functions. A wrapper function is like a helper that calls another function but adds something extra, like logging or error handling.

## **9. Closures**
- **File:** [09_closures.go](functions/09_closures.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces closures, which are functions that can "remember" the variables from the place they were created. They are helpful when you need to keep track of some data while working with functions.

## **10. Higher-Order Functions**
- **File:** [10_higher_order_functions.go](functions/10_higher_order_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains higher-order functions, which can take other functions as input or return them as output. These are great for writing flexible and reusable code.

## **11. Function Expressions**
- **File:** [11_function_expressions.go](functions/11_function_expressions.go)  
- **Description:** This file shows how to create a function and store it in a variable. Function expressions let you use functions in creative ways, like passing them around or changing them at runtime.

## **Conclusion**
Functions are like the workers in your code—they do the actual work. In this section, you’ll learn everything from the basics of creating a function to advanced ideas like closures and higher-order functions. By the end, you’ll know how to make your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to reuse.
