# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 7 - Functions**

## **1. Introduction to Functions**
- **File:** [01_function_basics.go](functions/01_function_basics.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the basics of functions in Go, including function definition, calling functions, and using named return values.

## **2. Variadic Functions**
- **File:** [02_variadic_functions.go](functions/02_variadic_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to create functions that accept a variable number of arguments, showcasing the use of variadic parameters.

## **3. defer**
- **File:** [03_defer_example.go](functions/03_defer_example.go)  
- **Description:** This file illustrates the concept of defer, which schedules a function call to be executed after the surrounding function returns.

## **4. Methods with Structs**
- **File:** [05_methods_with_structs.go](functions/05_methods_with_structs.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to define methods on structs, demonstrating how to associate behavior with data types.

## **5. Interfaces and Polymorphism**
- **File:** [05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go](functions/05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces interfaces and polymorphism in Go, explaining how interfaces define behavior and how different types can implement the same interface, allowing for interchangeable use.

## **6. Anonymous Functions**
- **File:** [06_anonymous_functions.go](functions/06_anonymous_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains anonymous functions in Go, demonstrating how functions can be defined without a name and used as first-class citizens.

## **7. Recursion**
- **File:** [07_recursion_example.go](functions/07_recursion_example.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates the concept of recursion in Go, showing how a function can call itself to solve problems.

## **8. Wrapper Functions**
- **File:** [08_wrapper_functions.go](functions/08_wrapper_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to create a wrapper function that can take another function as an argument and execute it.

## **9. Closures**
- **File:** [09_closures.go](functions/09_closures.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains closures in Go, demonstrating how functions can capture and remember the environment in which they were created.

## **10. Higher-Order Functions**
- **File:** [10_higher_order_functions.go](functions/10_higher_order_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to create higher-order functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.

## **11. Function Expressions**
- **File:** [11_function_expressions.go](functions/11_function_expressions.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to use function expressions to create functions dynamically and assign them to variables.
