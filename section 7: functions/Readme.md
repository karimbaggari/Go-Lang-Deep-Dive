# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 7 - Functions**

## **1. Introduction to Functions**
- **File:** [01_function_basics.go](functions/01_function_basics.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the fundamentals of functions in Go, including defining and calling functions, as well as using named return values for clarity and convenience.

## **2. Variadic Functions**
- **File:** [02_variadic_functions.go](functions/02_variadic_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to create and use variadic functions, which accept a variable number of arguments, making them versatile for scenarios like summing multiple numbers.

## **3. defer**
- **File:** [03_defer_example.go](functions/03_defer_example.go)  
- **Description:** This file illustrates the `defer` statement, which schedules a function call to run after the surrounding function completes, commonly used for resource cleanup.

## **4. Methods with Structs**
- **File:** [04_methods_with_structs.go](functions/04_methods_with_structs.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to define methods on structs, showing how Go supports adding behavior to data types by associating functions with them.

## **5. Interfaces and Polymorphism**
- **File:** [05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go](functions/05_interfaces_and_polymorphism.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces interfaces in Go, demonstrating how they enable polymorphism by allowing different types to implement the same interface, facilitating flexible and interchangeable designs.

## **6. Anonymous Functions**
- **File:** [06_anonymous_functions.go](functions/06_anonymous_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains anonymous functions, showcasing their use as first-class citizens that can be defined inline and passed as arguments.

## **7. Recursion**
- **File:** [07_recursion_example.go](functions/07_recursion_example.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates recursion, where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, such as calculating factorials or traversing data structures.

## **8. Wrapper Functions**
- **File:** [08_wrapper_functions.go](functions/08_wrapper_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates the creation of wrapper functions, which encapsulate other functions to add additional behavior or pre-/post-processing logic.

## **9. Closures**
- **File:** [09_closures.go](functions/09_closures.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains closures, highlighting how functions can capture and retain access to variables in their surrounding scope, enabling powerful programming patterns.

## **10. Higher-Order Functions**
- **File:** [10_higher_order_functions.go](functions/10_higher_order_functions.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates higher-order functions, which can take other functions as arguments or return them as results, enabling flexible and reusable code.

## **11. Function Expressions**
- **File:** [11_function_expressions.go](functions/11_function_expressions.go)  
- **Description:** This example shows how to use function expressions to define functions dynamically and assign them to variables, providing additional flexibility in function usage.

## **Conclusion**
Functions are the building blocks of Go programs, providing a way to organize, reuse, and encapsulate logic. This section covers a wide range of function-related concepts, from basics to advanced techniques like closures and higher-order functions, empowering you to write clean and efficient Go code.
