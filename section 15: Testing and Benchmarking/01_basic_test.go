// Output Explanation:
// Running `go test 01_basic_test.go` produces the following output:
// 1. `ok`: Indicates that all tests passed successfully.
// 2. `command-line-arguments`: Shows that the tests were run in the context of command-line arguments.
// 3. `timing such as 0.216s`: The total time taken to run the tests, which was 0.216 seconds as an example.
// Overall, this confirms that the test for the addition operation (2 + 3) produced the expected result (5) without any issues.
