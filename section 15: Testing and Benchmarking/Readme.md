# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 17 - Testing and Benchmarking**

## **1. Writing Tests**
- **File:** [01_basic_test.go](testing_benchmarking/01_basic_test.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to write basic tests in Go, verifying the correctness of functions. It introduces the `testing` package to ensure that the expected and actual results of an operation match. This is essential for catching bugs and validating functionality during development.

In this file, the `TestAdd` function checks if the addition of `2 + 3` results in `5`. If the result is different from what is expected, it prints an error message.

- **Key Concepts Covered:**
  - Writing basic test functions using `t.Errorf`.
  - Verifying the correctness of code via simple assertions.
  - Running tests using the `go test` command to verify results.

## **2. Writing Benchmarks**
- **File:** [02_benchmarking_test.go](testing_benchmarking/02_benchmarking_test.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to write benchmark tests in Go. Benchmark tests allow developers to measure the performance of code, helping identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the application. The benchmark function repeatedly runs code (in this case, adding `2 + 3`) and measures the time it takes to perform the operation.

The `BenchmarkAdd` function uses the `testing.B` struct to run the benchmark multiple times and measure its performance. The number of iterations is controlled by `b.N`, ensuring that the function runs enough times to produce statistically significant results.

- **Key Concepts Covered:**
  - Writing benchmark functions with `testing.B`.
  - Running benchmarks using the `go test -bench` command.
  - Analyzing performance and identifying potential bottlenecks.

## **Conclusion**
Testing and benchmarking are crucial to ensuring the quality and performance of your Go code. In this section:
- **Writing Tests**: We learned how to verify the correctness of code through basic tests.
- **Writing Benchmarks**: We explored how to measure performance and optimize critical parts of your application.

These practices help ensure that your codebase is both correct and performant.
