Key Points:


1. Zero Values:

The file demonstrates the concept of zero values in Go. When variables are declared but not initialized, they automatically receive a default value based on their type:
int defaults to 0
float64 defaults to 0.0
bool defaults to false
string defaults to an empty string ""
The program prints these zero values to the console, illustrating how Go handles uninitialized variables.


2. Blank Identifier:

the blank identifier (_), which is used to ignore a value returned by a function. In this case, the divide function returns both a quotient and a remainder, but only the quotient is needed for further processing.
This demonstrates a common practice in Go to avoid unused variable warnings while still utilizing the function's output.
