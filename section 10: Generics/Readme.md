# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 11 - Generics**

## **1. Introduction to Generics**
- **File:** [01_generics_intro.go](generics/01_generics_intro.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the concept of generics in Go, explaining how they allow for writing flexible and reusable code by enabling functions and data structures to operate on different types.

## **2. Type Constraints**
- **File:** [02_type_constraints.go](generics/02_type_constraints.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to define type constraints in Go, allowing functions to accept only certain types that satisfy specific conditions.

## **3. Type Constraints & Types**
- **File:** [03_type_constraints_and_types.go](generics/03_type_constraints_and_types.go)  
- **Description:** This file explores the relationship between type constraints and types, showing how to create generic functions that work with multiple types while enforcing constraints.

## **4. Type Alias and Underlying Types**
- **File:** [04_type_alias_and_underlying_types.go](generics/04_type_alias_and_underlying_types.go)  
- **Description:** This example illustrates how to create type aliases and understand underlying types in Go, providing insights into how generics can be applied to different data types.

## **5. Package Constraints**
- **File:** [05_package_constraints.go](generics/05_package_constraints.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains how to use package constraints in Go generics, allowing for more complex type relationships and interactions between different types.

## **6. Concrete Type vs. Interface Type**
- **File:** [06_concrete_vs_interface_type.go](generics/06_concrete_vs_interface_type.go)  
- **Description:** This example discusses the differences between concrete types and interface types in the context of generics, highlighting when to use each in Go programming.

## **7. Generic Data Structures**
- **File:** [07_generic_data_structures.go](generics/07_generic_data_structures.go)  
- **Description:** This file demonstrates how to create generic data structures, such as stacks and queues, that can operate on any data type.

## **8. Practical Examples of Generics**
- **File:** [08_practical_generics_examples.go](generics/08_practical_generics_examples.go)  
- **Description:** This example provides practical use cases for generics in Go, showcasing how they can simplify code and improve reusability.

## **Conclusion**
Generics in Go provide a powerful way to write flexible and reusable code. This section covers the fundamentals of generics, including type constraints, type aliases, and the differences between concrete and interface types, enabling developers to create more abstract and adaptable code structures.
