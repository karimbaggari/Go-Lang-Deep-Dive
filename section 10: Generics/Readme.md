# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 11 - Generics**

## **1. Introduction to Generics**
- **File:** [01_type_constraints.go.go](generics/01_type_constraints.go.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the concept of generics in Go, explaining how they allow for writing flexible and reusable code by enabling functions and data structures to operate on different types.

## **2. Type Constraints**
- **File:** [02_type_alias.go.go](generics/02_type_alias.go.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to define type constraints in Go, allowing functions to accept only certain types that satisfy specific conditions.

## **3. Type Constraints & Types**
- **File:** [03_generics_examples.go](generics/03_generics_examples.go)  
- **Description:** This file explores the relationship between type constraints and types, showing how to create generic functions that work with multiple types while enforcing constraints.



## **Conclusion**
Generics in Go provide a powerful way to write flexible and reusable code. This section covers the fundamentals of generics, including type constraints, type aliases, and the differences between concrete and interface types, enabling developers to create more abstract and adaptable code structures.
