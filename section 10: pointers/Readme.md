# **Deep Dive into Go: Section 10 - Pointers**

## **1. Introduction to Pointers**
- **File:** [01_pointers_intro.go](pointers/01_pointers_intro.go)  
- **Description:** This file introduces the concept of pointers in Go, explaining what pointers are and how they are used to reference memory locations.

## **2. Seeing Types & Values for Pointers**
- **File:** [02_types_and_values.go](pointers/02_types_and_values.go)  
- **Description:** This example demonstrates how to declare pointers, see their types, and understand the values they point to.

## **3. Dereferencing Pointers**
- **File:** [03_dereferencing_pointers.go](pointers/03_dereferencing_pointers.go)  
- **Description:** This file illustrates how to dereference pointers to access the value stored at the memory location they point to.

## **4. Pass by Value, Pointers, Reference Types, and Mutability**
- **File:** [04_pass_by_value_and_reference.go](pointers/04_pass_by_value_and_reference.go)  
- **Description:** This example discusses the differences between passing values and pointers to functions, highlighting how pointers can be used to modify the original data.

## **5. Pointer and Value Semantics Defined**
- **File:** [05_pointer_value_semantics.go](pointers/05_pointer_value_semantics.go)  
- **Description:** This file explains pointer and value semantics in Go, detailing how they affect memory management and data manipulation.

## **6. Pointer & Value Semantics Heuristic**
- **File:** [06_pointer_value_semantics_heuristic.go](pointers/06_pointer_value_semantics_heuristic.go)  
- **Description:** This example provides heuristics for deciding when to use pointers versus values in Go, helping developers make informed choices.

## **7. Pointers and Values: The Stack and the Heap**
- **File:** [07_stack_and_heap.go](pointers/07_stack_and_heap.go)  
- **Description:** This file discusses the differences between stack and heap memory in Go, explaining how pointers relate to these memory areas.

## **Conclusion**
Understanding pointers is essential for effective memory management in Go. This section covers the fundamentals of pointers, including their declaration, types, and how they relate to stack and heap memory.
